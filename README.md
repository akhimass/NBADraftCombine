# 🏀 Draft Combine Analytics

Welcome to the ** NBA Draft Combine Analytics** project — a data-driven pipeline that analyzes NBA Draft Combine metrics to identify traits that predict future player success, injury risk, and career archetypes.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project consolidates and processes NBA Draft Combine data (anthropometrics, shooting, agility, etc.) and merges it with career stats and injury data. It outputs interactive reports and correlation tables to help scouts, analysts, and researchers identify impactful player attributes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Import and clean combine data (2000–2025)
- 🔗 Merge combine data with:
  - Traditional career stats
  - Usage stats
  - Injury timelines
- 🧠 Split careers into early, mid, late stages
- 📈 Correlate combine traits with:
  - Success metrics (PTS, REB, AST, etc.)
  - Injury-prone archetypes
- 📤 Export results to Excel or Tableau-ready CSVs
